            Our goal is to position ourselves as the leading provider of complete solutions for the backup and standby
            power generation market, offering a comprehensive range of products and services.

            In response to the current power crisis situation in Bangladesh, our Energy and Power team is dedicated to
            meeting the country's power needs by providing machinery and services for backup power generation and
            storage systems.

            As the sole distributor of "GENMAC GENERATORS" from Italy in the local market, we offer their
            portable/industrial range of gasoline and diesel generators. With over 28 years of experience, GENMAC has
            been helping customers meet their critical backup power needs by providing affordable generator solutions.
            Since its establishment in 1983, GENMAC has evolved from being a generator manufacturer into a full-service
            supplier, systems integrator, and power solution provider.

            Our services include installation, routine servicing, and electrical fault handling for generators ranging
            from 2 KVA to 2000KVA, powered by petrol, diesel, or gas. We also supply spare parts, consumables, and
            accessories to ensure the smooth operation of our customers' generators. In the near future, we plan to
            introduce a fully managed generator rental service that will include facilitating bank loans and providing
            refueling services.

            In addition to conventional diesel generators, we have recently introduced the world-renowned "LEGRAND"
            brand UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) systems. Our focus is on industrial-level UPS, offering both
            modular systems and conventional systems. We provide UPS solutions ranging from 1.25KVA to 120KVA, along
            with comprehensive support and services to ensure uninterrupted power supply for our customers.

            Furthermore, we are actively conducting market and product research to expand our offerings into other areas
            such as air compressors, construction equipment, rectifiers, IPS (Instant Power Supply), and solar PV
            systems. By diversifying our product portfolio, we aim to provide a comprehensive range of power and cooling
            products to cater to the evolving needs of our customers.

            Our commitment to customer satisfaction extends beyond the sale of products. We prioritize providing
            excellent after-sales services, including maintenance, repairs, and technical support. Our team of skilled
            technicians and engineers are equipped with the necessary knowledge and expertise to handle any issues that
            may arise with our products.

            At ARS, we understand the importance of reliable power supply for businesses and individuals alike. We
            strive to deliver high-quality products and services that meet the specific requirements of our customers.
            Our partnerships with renowned brands such as GENMAC and LEGRAND ensure that we offer the latest
            technologies and solutions in the power generation industry.

            In conclusion, our Energy and Power team at ARS is dedicated to providing comprehensive solutions for the
            backup and standby power generation market. With our range of products and services, including generators,
            UPS systems, and future expansions into other power-related areas, we aim to meet the power needs of
            Bangladesh and ensure uninterrupted power supply for our customers. Our commitment to customer satisfaction,
            along with our partnerships with leading brands, positions us as a trusted provider in the industry
