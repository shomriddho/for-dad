          <h1>Performance Management</h1>
          <p>In today's rapidly changing IT sector, decision makers face increasing demands for IT and administrative
            information to comply with legal and customer-specific requirements.
             <!-- Performance Management (PM) is becoming
            increasingly important to meet these demands, but little is known about its usage in IT. The adoption of
            information and communication technology (ICT) in IT can improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality
            of IT services, transparency of economic activities, and real-time information availability. However, the
            causality between ICT investment and economic profitability remains unproven. Performance management in the
            IT industry is defined as a multidimensional phenomenon, considering financial, patient-related, and
            procedural aspects. Potential areas for measuring performance in healthcare include IT industry financial
            strength, IT services operations, people development, customer service and satisfaction, and IT marketing.

            The adoption of PM in IT is influenced by factors such as regulatory setting, complexity of new
            technologies, strategic targets, employee attitudes, and organizational structure. The future of PM adoption
            is influenced by factors such as changing regulations and increased market dynamics. However, the
            effectiveness of PM in use can be doubted due to the lack of a crucial link between organizational level and
            strategic level. Future work should focus on prioritizing areas for action in the sense of optimizing PM
            quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of IT organizations. -->
